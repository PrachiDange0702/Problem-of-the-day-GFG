Problem of the Day - Detect Cycle using DSU

Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-using-dsu/1

Question - Given an undirected graph with no self loops with V (from 0 to V-1) nodes and E edges, the task is to check if there is any cycle in the undirected graph.

Note: Solve the problem using disjoint set union (DSU).

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 1
Explanation: There is a cycle between 0->2->4->0
Example 2:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: The graph doesn't contain any cycle

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Complexity: O(V)

Constraints:
2 ≤ V ≤ 104
1 ≤ E ≤ 104
