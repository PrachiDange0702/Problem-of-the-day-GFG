Link of the Problem - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insert-in-a-sorted-list/1

Question - Given a linked list sorted in ascending order and an integer called data, insert data in the linked list such that the list remains sorted.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 25->36->47->58->69->80
data: 19
Output: 
19 25 36 47 58 69 80
Explanation:
After inserting 19 the sorted linked list will look like the one in the output.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 50->100
data: 75
Output: 
50 75 100
Explanation:
After inserting 75 the sorted linked list will look like the one in the output.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
-99999 <= A[i] <= 99999, for each valid i
