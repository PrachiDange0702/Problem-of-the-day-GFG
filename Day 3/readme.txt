Problem of the day - Delete nodes having greater value on right
Link to the problem - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-nodes-having-greater-value-on-right/1
Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes in the list which have any node on their right whose value is greater. (Not just immidiate Right , but entire List on the Right)

 

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15 11 6 3
Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are
the elements which have greater elements
on the following nodes. So, after deleting
them, the linked list would like be 15,
11, 6, 3.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60
Output: 60
Explanation: All the nodes except the last
node has a greater value node on its right,
so all the nodes except the last node must
be removed

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 105
1 ≤ element of linked list ≤ 105
Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.
