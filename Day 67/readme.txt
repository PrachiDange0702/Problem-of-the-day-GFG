Problem of the day - Top K Frequent Elements in Array

Link of the Problem - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/top-k-frequent-elements-in-array/1

Question - Given a non-empty array nums[] of integers of length N, find the top k elements which have the highest frequency in the array. If two numbers have same frequencies, then the larger number should be given more preference.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
nums = {1,1,1,2,2,3}
k = 2
Output: {1, 2}
Example 2:

Input:
N = 8
nums = {1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4}
k = 2
Output: {3, 2}
Explanation: Elements 1 and 2 have the
same frequency ie. 2. Therefore, in this
case, the answer includes the element 2
as 2 > 1.

Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1<= nums[i] <=105
1 <= k <= N
