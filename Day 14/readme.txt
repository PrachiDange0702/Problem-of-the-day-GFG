Link of the code - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insert-a-node-in-a-bst/1

Question - Given a BST and a key K. If K is not present in the BST, Insert a new Node with a value equal to K into the BST. If K is already present in the BST, don't modify the BST.

Example 1:

Input:
     2
   /   \   1     3
K = 4
Output: 
1 2 3 4
Explanation: 
After inserting the node 4
Inorder traversal will be 1 2 3 4.
Example 2:

Input:
        2
      /   \
     1     3
             \
              6
K = 4
Output: 
1 2 3 4 6
Explanation: 
After inserting the node 4
Inorder traversal of the above tree will be 1 2 3 4 6.
