Problem of the Day: Remove duplicate Element from sorted Linked List
Question : Given a singly linked list consisting of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

Example : 
Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->4->5
Output: 2 4 5
Explanation: In the given linked list 
2 ->2 -> 4-> 5, only 2 occurs more 
than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.  
                                                                                                             
Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
