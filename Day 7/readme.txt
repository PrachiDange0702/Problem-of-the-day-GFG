Question - Given two Binary Trees. Check whether they are Isomorphic or not.

Example 1:

Input:
 T1    1     T2:   1
     /   \        /  \
    2     3      3    2
   /            /
  4            4
Output: No

Example 2:

Input:
T1    1     T2:    1
    /  \         /   \
   2    3       3     2
  /                    \
  4                     4
Output: Yes

Expected Time Complexity: O(min(M, N)) where M and N are the sizes of the two trees.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(min(H1, H2)) where H1 and H2 are the heights of the two trees.

Constraints:
1<=Number of nodes<=105
