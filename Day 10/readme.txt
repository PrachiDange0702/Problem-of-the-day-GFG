Problem of the - Mother Vertex

Link of the Problem - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mother-vertex/1

Question -Given a Directed Graph, find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (if present). 
A Mother Vertex is a vertex through which we can reach all the other vertices of the Graph.

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: According to the given edges, all 
nodes can be reached from nodes from 0, 1 and 2. 
But, since 0 is minimum among 0,1 and 2, so 0 
is the output.
Example 2:

Input: 

Output: -1
Explanation: According to the given edges, 
no vertices are there from where we can 
reach all vertices. So, output is -1.
