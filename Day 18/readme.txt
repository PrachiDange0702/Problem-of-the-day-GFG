Question -Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum, the task is to count all subsets of the given array with a sum equal to a given sum.

Note: Answer can be very large, so, output answer modulo 109+7

Example 1:

Input: N = 6, arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}
       sum = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: {2, 3, 5}, {2, 8}, {10} are 
possible subsets.
Example 2:
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       sum = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 5}, 
{2, 3, 5} are possible subsets.
