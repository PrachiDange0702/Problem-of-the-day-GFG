Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-string-is-rotated-by-two-places-1587115620/1

Question - Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if the string 'b' can be obtained by rotating (in any direction) string 'a' by exactly 2 places.

Example 1:

Input:
a = amazon
b = azonam
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
amazon can be rotated anti-clockwise by two places, which will make it as azonam.
Example 2:

Input:
a = geeksforgeeks
b = geeksgeeksfor
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
If we rotate geeksforgeeks by two place in any direction, we won't get geeksgeeksfor.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxilary Complexity: O(N).
Challenge: Try doing it in O(1) space complexity.

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of a, b ≤ 105
