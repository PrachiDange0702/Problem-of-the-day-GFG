Problem of the day - reverse alternate nodes in linkedlist.

Link - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/given-a-linked-list-reverse-alternate-nodes-and-append-at-the-end/1

Question - Given a linked list, you have to perform the following task:

Extract the alternative nodes starting from second node.
Reverse the extracted list.
Append the extracted list at the end of the original list.
Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra memory.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 10->4->9->1->3->5->9->4
Output: 
10 9 3 9 4 5 1 4
Explanation: 
Alternative nodes in the given linked list are 4,1,5,4. Reversing the alternative nodes from the given list, and then appending them to the end of the list results in a list 10->9->3->9->4->5->1->4.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList = 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 
1 3 5 4 2 
Explanation:
Alternative nodes in the given linked list are 2 and 4. Reversing the alternative nodes from the given list, and then appending them to the end of the list results in a list 1->3->5->4->2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= Node_value <= 109
